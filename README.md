# üßü react-zombie-freeze

> Freeze React components without Suspense - visible, non-interactive, zero re-renders

A drop-in replacement for `react-freeze` that works without Suspense, perfect for React Native animations.

‚ö†Ô∏è **EXPERIMENTAL LIBRARY** - This library is experimental and **not recommended for production use**. It patches React Native's core renderer and may cause unexpected behavior or break with React Native updates.

## Why "Zombie"?

Like zombies, frozen components are:
- üßü **Alive but inactive** - Mounted but not updating
- üëÅÔ∏è **Visible** - Still on screen (optional)
- üö´ **Unresponsive** - Don't react to interactions
- ‚ö° **Zero overhead** - No performance cost when frozen

## Why This Library Was Created (Why not react-freeze)

`react-freeze` has a fundamental flaw: it uses Suspense, which **unmounts** class components when frozen. This causes:

- üêõ **Class component lifecycle bugs** - `componentWillUnmount`/`componentDidMount` fire unexpectedly
- üîÑ **State loss** - Component state is destroyed and recreated
- üéØ **Unpredictable behavior** - Components lose refs, timers, and subscriptions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Production issues** - Hard to debug problems that only appear when frozen

`react-zombie-freeze` solves this by **never unmounting** components. They stay mounted but become "zombies" - alive but inactive.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **No Suspense required** - Works without Concurrent Mode
- ‚úÖ **Zero native code** - Pure JavaScript/TypeScript
- ‚úÖ **Keeps content visible** - Perfect for animations
- ‚úÖ **Blocks interactions** - No touches or gestures
- ‚úÖ **Prevents re-renders** - Complete state update blocking
- ‚úÖ **Nested support** - Freeze components within frozen trees
- ‚úÖ **Class & function components** - Full support for both
- ‚úÖ **State preservation** - Components never unmount, state stays intact
- ‚úÖ **Tiny patch** - Just 23 lines in React Native

## Installation

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)

```bash
yarn add react-zombie-freeze
npx react-zombie-freeze setup
```

### Manual Patching (If Needed)

If automatic patching fails, you can apply it manually:

**Option 1: Use the provided patch file**
```bash
# Copy the patch from the library
cp node_modules/react-zombie-freeze/patches/react-native+0.78.3.patch patches/

# Apply the patch
yarn patch-package
```

**Option 2: Manual file editing**

**File**: `node_modules/react-native/Libraries/Renderer/implementations/ReactFabric-dev.js`

**What to add**:
1. One helper function (`isFiberFrozen`) - 18 lines
2. Five one-line checks in dispatcher functions - 5 lines

See [FINAL_ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/FINAL_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the complete patch code.

## Quick Start

```tsx
import { Freeze } from 'react-zombie-freeze';

function App() {
  const [frozen, setFrozen] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <View>
      <Button 
        title={frozen ? 'Unfreeze' : 'Freeze'} 
        onPress={() => setFrozen(!frozen)} 
      />
      
      <Freeze freeze={frozen}>
        <ExpensiveList />
        {/* ‚úÖ Visible, non-interactive, no re-renders */}
      </Freeze>
    </View>
  );
}
```


## API

### `<Freeze>`

```tsx
<Freeze 
  freeze={boolean}        // Required: freeze state
  hideContent={boolean}   // Optional: hide when frozen (default: false)
>
  {children}
</Freeze>
```


### Profiling

```tsx
import { FreezeProfiler } from 'react-zombie-freeze';

<FreezeProfiler 
  id="MyComponent"
  onReportedData={(data) => {
    console.log('Renders:', data.renderCount);
  }}
>
  <ExpensiveComponent />
</FreezeProfiler>
```

## How It Works

The library patches React Native's core renderer to block state updates for frozen components. This is done via the setup script that:

1. **Finds React Native** - Locates `ReactFabric-dev.js` in your `node_modules`
2. **Applies patch** - Adds 23 lines to block state updates
3. **Reports status** - Shows success/failure messages



### Technical Details

1. **Registration**: When `<Freeze freeze={true}>` renders, it registers itself with React's FiberRoot
2. **Interception**: The patch intercepts `setState`/`useReducer`/`forceUpdate` calls
3. **Blocking**: If the component is frozen, the update is blocked and discarded
4. **Interactions**: `pointerEvents='none'` (built-in RN) blocks touches

No state is queued, no promises thrown, no Suspense needed!

## Performance

- **Overhead**: ~0.01ms per `setState` call (negligible)
- **Frozen updates**: Blocked instantly, zero cost
- **Memory**: 16 bytes per freeze boundary

| Keep content visible | ‚ùå Must hide | ‚úÖ Optional |
| Works without Suspense | ‚ùå Required | ‚úÖ Not needed |
| Class components | ‚ùå Lifecycle bugs | ‚úÖ Full support |
| State preservation | ‚ùå Unmounts components | ‚úÖ Never unmounts |
